    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is mostly an elaboration upon the explanation of Transformers given in Chapter 11 of Dive Into Deep Learning. If you want to run this notebook, you can see from above that you will need certain libraries. If this stuff is new to you, then follow the [installation guide of DIDL](https://d2l.ai/chapter_installation/index.html#chap-installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I seldom write technical explanations of things, ever since I stopped writing books when the age of everywhere-everything knowledge seemed to arrive via longform articles and various forums. What can I add to the plethora of materials from those with time to write and skilful things to say?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I found various explanations of Transformers to be lacking in crucial details, sometimes irritatingly so. There are quite a few annotations of papers/code without bringing crucial foundational knowledge to the fore, such as recognizing when researchers have probably made certain assumptions which they failed to explain because they got the results they wanted anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, perhaps rather foolishly, this is an attempt to explain Transformers right down to the lowest-level of key operations __whilst attempting to blend in some intuition with various nods to theory__, minus stringent mathematical exposition and jargon. The goal is not just explanation, but demystification. Very often, we encounter things that, whilst we understand (eventually) how they work, we aren't quite sure as to why they work or what made the inventors choose to include them in their approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, many things, especially in deep learning, can be explained via a variety of perspectives. Many researchers or commentators take a certain perspective based upon habit or learning, thereby adopting a set of terms of ideas that might not be so accessible to others coming from a different tradition. I attempt, here and there, to stitch together a few perspectives, e.g. from signal processing, engineering, linguistics, etc. Moreover, researchers often use technical terms in a non-technical sense, and vice-versa, which can confuse the unsuspecting reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "I include attempts to probe into __some__ of the technical decisions in order to demystify them, noting that we can easily overlook how the output of a research paper is often the end product of lots of intermediate experiments that allowed the researchers to arrive at their conclusions -- i.e. whilst the technicalities of a paper can appear intimidating in their precision or decisiveness, we are not seeing all of the \"workings out\" that went into producing them via many experiments and edits of the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as we shall see, some of the technical decisions perhaps don't make sense. This might well be legitimate, in the sense that many things in __Deep Learning (DL)__ work even though there often lacks a rigorous explanation as to why. This should give us hope when exploring our own ideas -- i.e. they might work, and hence why playing around is so important with your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the tools these days (e.g. Pytorch and open source code) to experiment with almost luxurious ease, time-permitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, and not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I will attempt to blend the open-source materials from these two sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/attention-scoring-functions.html\n",
    "- https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/03_transformer-anatomy.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of other good sources (e.g. the [Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)) but I selected these particular ones because they are part of wider learning programs wherein students who are following them might benefit from a more expanded explanation of the Transformer piece whilst providing a comparison of two approaches. Whilst they are broadly similar, they have some key differences (in implementation) that might confuse those performing comparisons. As the baseline, I more closely follow the D2L example because it ends up with a finished \"from-scratch\" Transformer model that can be trained on a small French-English dataset that the book authors include in their resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a bit long, but I believe that diligently working through it will save you time versus trying to parse the original sources (where many details and intuitions are missed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attention: Function, or Look-up Table?\n",
    "\n",
    "First we consider the primary building block -- the attention function. In itself, it is just a method of computing relationships between a set of numerical samples wherein the set members presumably have non-random joint probabilities -- i.e. some kind of \"relatedness\". We expect this for language sampled from a text because word-order is required to impart meaning via syntactical rules, such as [subject-predicate](https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/sentelmt.htm) clauses. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to appreciate is that many inventions or ideas in technical work have been thought of before or arrived at via various thinkers from different perspectives. Hence, the starting point for self-attention that [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/) favors is more related to an exposition of [differentiable associative memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQtPoDnauq4&list=PLLHTzKZzVU9e6xUfG10TkTWApKSZCzuBI&index=19). One can think of the self-attention mechanism as a look-up table, or memory, whereby we can feed a set of tokens (word embeddings) as queries and look-up a bunch of values depending upon how the queries match with keys (\"addresses\") that point to the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lest we forget, a look-up table can be used to \"compute\" any function -- after all, this is how log and trig tables work, for those who've seen such things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vitally, the design of the associative memory is differentiable, meaning that its \"look-up\" processes can be defined as a composite of functions wherein each function is differentiable. This look-up memory perspective is useful from a more generalized \"thinking about deep learning\" perspective, which we should always try to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could begin with the thought: what if we could use a look-up table in our networks? You might imagine all kinds of uses. In this case, the mechanism is used to input words from a set to \"look-up\" each other word and return values of \"relatedness\". Consider the set of words `{boy, street, man, into, the, ran}`. Now imagine this as an ordered set, namely a sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `The boy ran into the street`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the word `boy` has some relationship with `ran`, but probably not so much with `street`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, consider a look-up table for this set into which we input the word `boy` and get back the most-related word -- i.e. `ran`. Or consider that it returns all words, but with scores that indicate relatedness. Hopefully, this concept is straightfoward, but why, then, do we need it to be differentiable and what might that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In any DL context, differentiable is synonymous with trainable. Consider another sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `The street boy looked hungry.`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this configuration, there is now a relationship between `boy` and `street`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our memory would be rather useless if it could not adapt (learn), otherwis it might only know how to relate subjects with predicates (in the first sentence) and not adjectives with nouns (in the second sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a memory that can adapt so as to learn, for any particular set, how it should compute relatedness. This, in essence, is what the self-attention mechanism is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We should first consider, in general, what sort of function -- irrespective of learning -- might allow us to measure the relaitionships between members of a set. This is the so-called \"Attention\" function. Its power comes slightly later when we figure out how to make this memory learn via a differentiable process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would anyone think to use a differentiable memory in the first place? The answer is that in problems that need to observe samples that span a sequence, it seems obvious that in order to make decisions about any position in the sequence, we probably need to pay attention to what came before it. For those of you with an electronic engineering background, you might recognize this a a [finite state machine (FSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). However, unlike an FSM, the hope with Transformers is that we can avoid recurrent structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without looking ahead to the so-called attention mechanism (next), electronic engineers familiar with digital signal processing might also appreciate that recurrent structures can often be replaced with parallel ones: [IIRs vs. FIRs](https://circuitglobe.com/difference-between-fir-filter-and-iir-filter.html#:~:text=The%20crucial%20difference%20between%20FIR,duration%20for%20a%20dynamic%20system.). The key point is that with text, at least when training, we already have all the samples \"in parallel\", so it seemed obvious that at some point someone would think to process them in parallel (within some reasonable limit of parallel processing efficiency gains). This is, in essence, what self-attention is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In consideration of the Attention function, the D2L book first emphasizes the need for a crucial sub-block called Masked Softmax. We will follow the same ordering (more or less) of component-level scrutiny so as to be consitent with the book's layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing with words in our network, there are efficiency gains from presenting all samples (at least within a given batch for processing) as if they are the same length, whether or not they are in reality. We do this by appending padding tokens to all sequences longer than some maximum (presumably the longest sentence, if we were presenting data one sentence at a time):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `The boy ran into the street` -- length 6 words\n",
    "- `The boy fell down` -- length 4 words, which becomes `The boy fell down [PAD] [PAD]` -- length 6 words\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from our attention function, as mentinoed in the preamble, is going to be a set of scores that convey the relatedness of set members. These scores will have a numeric range (somewhat constrained by another normalizing process we shall mention later) and we want to treat them as probabilities, hence a softmax is applied to the scores. But we do not want the softmax to be skewed by the `[PAD]` tokens, so we mask them out, per the function below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this function expects an mask `valid_len` which is the valid length of the set, which in the case of the first sentence is `6` (we want to measure all 6 tokens) and in the case of the second sentence is `4` -- we only want to softmax across the first 4 outputs from the function."

    "\n",
    "Why should we do this? Let's dwell for a moment on forming our intuitions so that the operation of the MHA makes more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that words can map to dense embeddings -- e.g. [see lecture](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos402/lectures/402-lec10.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, we want to compute conditional probabilities related to sequences of tokens. A good example is per the [book](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/03_transformer-anatomy.ipynb) in consideration of two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Time *flies* like an arrow`\n",
    "- `Fruit *flies* like a banana`\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that the word `flies` belongs in each sequence is conditional upon the context. Here we consider context to mean the other words in the sentence. But context could be even wider. For example, consider the wider context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `There are many metaphors for thinking about time. For example: time *___* like an arrow.` __(Context A)__\n",
    "- `Insects are often attracted to fruit. For example, fruit *___* like a banana` __(Context B)__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are both syntactial probabilities and semantic ones. Syntatically speaking, `P(___=='robot' | Context A)` is very small indeed because the bi-gram `time robot` is probably very low within the corpus (assuming it's an unusual phrase, although not implausible -- e.g. could be a sci-fi object). Or, consider that `P(___=='dog' | Context B)` is probably very likely to be quite low given that it is syntactially incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how might we compute that `flies` is a likely candidate in either context?\n",
    "\n",
    "In __Context A__ we can see (from human understanding) that there is some kind of connection with the word `arrow` because of the conjunction `like an`. We therefore mentally skew our attention towards `arrow` in deciding likely candidates for the blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we can train our network to see many examples of the pattern `X is like a Y`. Then we could imagine skewing our weighted-sum (scaled dot product attention function) to \"pull\" the candidate word towards the subject (`arrow`). In other words (forgive the pun) we want to find a word embedding vector that algebraically connects `___` to `arrow`. Of course, that algebraic formula is some complex (\"blackbox\") set of projections to get us there, aided by the vectors from the rest of the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, we can think of training one attention function to learn the pattern `X is like a Y` in its simile sense and to apply this to our inputs to see what candidate words emerge to complete our sequence as a simile. Furthermore, perhaps the presence of the word `metaphors` and `time` in the previous clause cause the transformation to skew towards words found in metaphors related to time, like `time flies when you're having fun` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of __Context B__ we can imagine that a network has learned the pattern `X like a Y` in the sense of affection or preference: `Cats like a nap (in the sun)`. And this is different again from other senses of the word `like`, such as the sense of being similar `I was worried __something like this__ would happen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can imagine one possible configuration of an attention operation that learns and overlays the \"affection pattern\" and so computes vector transformations that puts us in the embedding space in the neighborhood of objects that could complete the phrase `<objects> like (as in have affection/preference for) bananas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, based upon our network having seen lots of text, we have a set of candidates for that: `monkeys, kids, flies, insects, gorillas` etc. Clearly, within the high dimensional embeddings space, we can suppose that `monkeys, flies, insects, gorillas` are nearby each other within a features subspace that discriminates biological creatures, as in animals. We can suppose that this cluster of vectors is somewhat distant from a cluster, or subspace, related to young people, like `kids, children, youth, girls, boys` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now consider the broader vector space of the input __Context B__ wherein the subject of the previous sentence is `insects`. Clearly, the word `insects` is related to the blank -- that's what we, as humans, would do to bridge this gap. From a point of view of sentence structure and semantic meaning, it is common for the subject of a previous sentence to get picked up by a follow-on sentence: `Insects blah blah blah... For example, flies blah blah blah`. Here we can see logical semantic structure even with a whole bunch of `blah blah blah` fillers -- i.e. you could probably make a whole bunch of sentences that fit this pattern:\n",

    "> __Insects__ can be annoying. __For example__, flies make buzzing noises.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Insects__ are drawn to dead things. __For example__, flies like meat.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer an analogy from computer vision, we can think of each learned attention pattern as a set of kernels in the convolutional network and our output patterns as like the feature maps.\n",

We can do this because a linear layer is just a \"vertical\" stack of hidden units.\n",

But what about the reduced width of the attention mechanism: `r=p/N` (where `p` -- the final-layer output dimension is set to be `d`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can save computational complexity by reducing the dimension of the scaled-dot-product attention function, recalling that the function itself is invariant to this dimension (and to sequence length). By invariant, we mean that the operation is purely functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we set the hidden-state dimension to be `r` which we said is nominally set to be `p/N` where `p` is the width of the final output matrix (and hence the width of the final output) often set to `d` so as to maintain our original embedding space dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that our attention operation is taking place in a reduced-dimensionality space with only `r` features. What does this mean after we initally gave the impression that the attention mechanism works in the original token space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear layers in the Multi-head attention map the token space to a set of functions in a narrower space that we might imagine could be performed with satisfactory performance in a lower dimension space, namely the `p/N` space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, there is a tension here between `N` and `p/N` -- i.e. if we use this approach, then the bigger the number of heads, the lower dimensioned they become.\n",

    "However, what kind of function are we attempting to learn? We are hoping that the distribution of relative positions of sequenced elements can be modeled in a way that collapses into a set of common attention patterns. Moreover, we want this to occur at each layer in the final model not too dissimilar to multiple convolution layers with pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our embedding space (dimension `d`) is the highest level of resolution in terms of feature sampling, say 768 in the case of Bert. If we backprop to find a function that maps `q,k,v` to a lower dimensional space for attention, then we can think of this as a compression to a set of features that are picking out the self-attentional characteristics of the underyling token-space distribution. Although not strictly analogous, we can think of this as a kind of kernel-size and stride choice in convolutional networks.\n",

    "## Where Are We?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have taken a batch of sequence samples and fed them into a multi-head attention network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/5dce9357463435c7208bf5e1a4cc5be6e49e0a40//images/chapter03_multihead-attention.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output thus far is in latent space, not unlike the hidden state in an RNN. This is what an encoder does -- it encodes one sample space into a another, lower-dimension, \"feature representation\" space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial encoding is the embedding layer, which is not shown here as we are taking the embedded vectors as given, passing them as inputs: `q,k,v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the abstract level, our process is operating on sets. This is not yet a Sequence2Sequence arrangement. Indeed, there is no concept of sequence that our network knows about -- the input tokens are allowed to attend to each other without any part of the function being token-position dependent. Although we know that the tokens are going to be in coherent (presumably) syntactical order (left to right or right to left, depending upon the language), the network has not such distriminating features -- yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this level, the network is using a method to compare set members with each other and product an output set -- i.e. it is a Set2Set network. We are using mutual dot products across the set. We expect that some weighted dot products will hold useful information, but it depends upon how the network is trained -- i.e. an objective function when backpropagated will cause the linear layers to learn functions that make the relatedness of set members useful in ways that are learnable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence why we can say that this arrangement of self-attention is like a differentiable associative memory. The memory will make associations between members and we can differentiate to allow backpropagation to update those associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this can only happen because there is some structural features (with non-random distributions) in the original sample space just like neighboring pixels in an image have probabilistic relationships (vs. pixels far apart). This remains a key assumption for all language-modelling approaches, per the original distribtion hypothesis that the meaning of words is affected by surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't know how each word in a sequence affects each other. We know that language works via non-linear order, such as the sentence: `The boy is the one who hit the ball.` In this sentence, the subject `boy` attends to the predicate `hit the ball`, especially the verb `hit`, but over a span of interstitial words:\n",
    "\n",
    "`___ boy ___ ___ ___ ___ hit ___ ___`\n",
    "\n",
    "Such spans can, in theory (with correct syntax) be of any length -- i.e. very long sentences with lots of sub-clauses are perfectly fine, but obviously rare. Over a reasonable window of text, we expect a certain distribution of conditional probabilities (under different attention patterns) and so we are hopeful that our self-attention apparatus can learn them. We haven't yet discussed multiple layers of self-attention, but it is not hard to understand how attention \"rolls-up\" to higher levels of abstraction. After all, the subject matter of an entire text is the highest unit of abstraction and might well factor eventually in the conditional and joint probabilities of not only individual self-attention between words, but self-attention between clauses, sentences, paragraphs etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all statistical approaches, we are not concerned with any rules per se, as in the rules of syntax, grammar or semantics. We expect that given enough data samples and with the right approach, we can discover these rules as latent encodings in the data as expressed through functions whose raw inputs are the sample space of the tokens (i.e. word embeddings). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that self-attention patterns are, as just discussed in the `boy... hit` exmpample, spread across the surrounding texts in different ways, we can see how the self-attention many-to-may (or Set2Set) architecture caters well for that consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://d2l.ai/_images/cnn-rnn-self-attention.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the attention architecture can be completely parallel, requiring no iterative operations (unlike an RNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can immediately see an interesting question that arises from this diagram. Why should it be the case that with images we don't apply the same self attentional approach. Although we know that the data structure is a 2D pixel, the pixel-content distributions of natural images (or most likely any rule-based image generator) are not necessarily bound to the relatively arbitrary coincidence with an overlaying grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes -- you have guessed it -- we can use transformers for image processing (though not discussed here).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Completing the Encoder Block\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have described and hopefully explained the workings and intuitions of Multi-headed Attention including some of the implementation details of the D2L code with its masked softmax and parallel (partitioned) weights matrices for `Q,K,V`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's turn our attention to how this component is incorporated into a complete encoder block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is able to perform parallel operations on all tokens at once. We have no means to compute self-attention based upon position. In other words, if we compare `token_A` with `token_B`, it makes no difference where these tokens lie in the set, or in relation to each other. However, positional consideration is clearly important for language because position matters. Consider the following sentences, both with an identical set of words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `The man did it, said the boy.`\n",
    "- `The man said the boy did it.`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expect in our embedding space to probably find features that connect nouns capable of speech, like `man` and `boy` will be related to speech acts, like `said`. So, from a self-attention perspective, it would be reasonable to expect that word `said` ought to pay attention to the words `boy, man`. However, clearly position in the sequence matters, as the two sentences illustrate wherein very opposite meanings are obtained with exactly the same set of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it would be preferable if we could incorporate the positional information into the self-attention. Perhaps this seems obvious and you thought this was already the case, but our function currently has no regard for position.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore need to find a way to add positional encoding into our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the easiest way to understand a possible approach is to consider positional encodings that are learned, not unlike embeddings. This is the method discussed in the Transformers book and is fairly easy to appreciate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their proposed approach involves adding a second embedding layer to the input:"

    "What kind of intuitions might we form for this kind of vector addition __in the embedding space?__\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be reasonable to think that position is already encoded in the original embedding space by virtue of the positional nature that apparently exists when interpreting meaning within texts, both syntatically and semantically. And we might then conclude that the positional vector is moving the underlying embedding vector into a more \"position-relevant\" expression that gets learned by the network.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Indeed, if positional encodings, of any kind, are injected into the embedding vectors prior to self-attention, then the function might pay attention to position-to-position correlations that are meaningless -- i.e. they represent noise. This is discussed in [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=09-528y2Fgf) that proposes a more robust approach. Put it this way: there is no value in merely knowing that a word exists in slot 1 of the sequence vs. slot 7. Take the sentences:\n",

    "- `The man said the boy did it.`\n",
    "- `Running uphill provides a more vigorous workout.` -- My own preference for running :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or take all 7-word sentences in the training data -- it is likely that the distribution of words in slot 7 doesn't hold much discriminatory information. The slots themselves, absent of word meaning, have no obvious significance. Nonetheless, encoding this data via superposition of the embeddings vector appears to work. This is most likely because it gives enough signal for the network to learn something positional-wise that translates into improved performance via self-attention.\n",

This is the \"dirty secret\" of DL -- various things might work (or not) without the availability of a rigorous explanation as to why. If they do, we might continue to use them. This is why you should __always attempt to experiment__ with your network implementations, process-power allowing.\n",

    "> We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PE pos+k can be represented as a linear function of PE pos.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was not proven in the paper, but [the proof](https://timodenk.com/blog/linear-relationships-in-the-transformers-positional-encoding/) is easily accessible and demonstrable with basic trig and linear algebra. \n",

It happens when we end up in our loss-function space where the partial deriatives w.r.t. weights are very small -- i.e. the gradient is shallow. Combine this with a potentially small learning rate and our weight updates are so small as to drive the network into a stall -- i.e. it stops learning.\n",

    "Moreover, the second purpose is that by \"leaking\" the input through to the next layer, that next layer can attend to both the original (previous layer) features and the processed features (\"feature map\") of the input space. In intuitive terms, this allows the network to access more information wherein patterns can be identified in the interaction of different feature spaces without so limiting the processing to only pay attention to features accessible in the output of the preceding layer.\n",

    "Just because our DL networks have layers, there is no need to assume that the abstraction into different feature spaces need be confined to layers. Perhaps there are modes of language modeling that can make sense of abstract features, say grammatical tense, __in combination with__ lower level syntactical features -- i.e. language understanding is hierarchical across the various layers of abstraction versus purely functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst these intuitions make sense, we should be aware that they don't have to per se. So long as our entire process is differentiable, we can construct any architecture we like if we believe it to be of value. This is the joy of experimenting with frameworks like Pytorch where backprop is taken care of automatically via autograd. keep in mind that researchers will often try many alternatives before finding one that works -- the one that gets reported. We shouldn't receive the report as some kind of well thought-out genius -- it can very well be the result of lots of experimentation, much of it trial and error.\n",

In this case, each position in the sequence is subjected to the same operation. I guess this benefits from being pointed out with an explicit name lest we might think it a better idea to treat each position with a separately learned network.
